# Detecting Hateful and Offensive Language with Transfer-Learned Models

This repository consists of code to collect data, further train BERT and to run BERT classifiers on several datasets. Most of the runs in this repository requires a lot of computational power. During the thesis, NTNU's IDUN server was used to compute the results.

Data is not included in this repository as most of the dataset are not allowed to be redistributed.
